        "\n# Estimating marginal cumulative incidence functions\n\nThis example demonstrates how to estimate the marginal cumulative incidence\nusing :class:`hazardous.GradientBoostingIncidence` and compares the results to\nthe Aalen-Johansen estimator and to the theoretical cumulated incidence curves\non synthetic data.\n\nHere the data is generated by taking the minimum time of samples from three\ncompeting Weibull distributions with fixed parameters and without any\nconditioning covariate. In this case, the Aalen-Johansen estimator is expected\nto be unbiased, and this is empirically confirmed by this example.\n\nThe :class:`hazardous.GradientBoostingIncidence` estimator on the other hand is\na predictive estimator that expects at least one conditioning covariate. In\nthis example, we use a dummy covariate that is constant for all samples. Here\nwe are not interested in the discrimination power of the estimator: there is\nnone by construction, since we do not have access to informative covariates.\nInstead we empirically study its marginal calibration, that is, its ability to\napproximately recover an unbiased estimate of the marginal cumulative incidence\nfunction for each competing event.\n\nThis example also highlights that :class:`hazardous.GradientBoostingIncidence`\nestimates noisy cumulative incidence functions, which are not smooth and not\neven monotonically increasing. This is a known limitation of the estimator,\nand attempting to enforce monotonicity at training time typically introduces\nsevere over-estimation bias for large time horizons.\n"
